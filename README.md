Workvivo UI Cleaner ReadMe:

Workvivo appears to prevent users from setting up the user interface to their liking when showing a livestream or recording playback.

- The description can't be hidden once you've read it
- The emojis that overlay the video can be annoying and get in the way of adjusting video settings.
- The chat can be distracting

This script, to be run directly in the browser console, provides you with three buttons:
1. Hide/show description
2. Hide/show chat
3. Hide/show emojis

That's it!


INSTRUCTIONS:
 - When watching a livestream or recorded video on Workvivo
 - Right click anywhere on the browser page, and choose 'Inspect'
 - Select the tab called 'Console'
 - Paste all of this script into the console and press 'Enter'. You can now close the browser developer tools pane.
 - You'll see three green buttons at the bottom of the screen to show/hide the description, chat and emojis 
 
 Any issues contact me via the issues tab above. If you're a colleague at my company, feel free to reach out in Teams - Daniel Aldous-Critchley.

Note: this script relies on the page DOM at the time of writing. If it stops working, then Workvivo has updated it.
